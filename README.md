# aws

In this repo I am trying to develop tool(s) which can be used with AWS API. 

Some scripts in this repo (under `./iot/`) are developed for the OpenNebula's AWS GreenGrass appliance. The purpose of these scripts is to ease and automate working with the AWS GreenGrass for which I did not find any truly easy and useful tool (for my liking).

Initial versions of these scripts are just quick and dirty attempts to use AWS API provided by the python boto3 library:

- https://boto3.amazonaws.com/v1/documentation/api/latest/index.html

Especially for **IoT/GreenGrass**:

- https://boto3.amazonaws.com/v1/documentation/api/latest/reference/services/iot.html
- https://boto3.amazonaws.com/v1/documentation/api/latest/reference/services/greengrass.html

Hopefully, I (soon) will forge those hack scripts into more pleasant and versatile (one) tool which can be used to talk with AWS API in an intuitive way.
